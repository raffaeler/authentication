Authentication using Keycloak and OpenId Connect with .NET and Javascript

Initially the demo was based on `localhost` and various other fakes. Now the apps are all mapped to **non-existent** `iamraf.net` sub-domains.

In order to test this locally I used a separate dns server but you can add the various hosts to the `hosts` file on your machine. Be aware that, in order to run this demo, you also require to set-up the Keycloak container as explained in the docs section and configure appropriately the `Demo` realm.

Feel free to open an issue to get help from me about this code or the related configurations.
