# Front-end application

There are currently 2 different front-ends, both using the react framework.

- `react-spa` uses an oidc library that will soon be deprecated
- `spa-ui` uses the new version of the same library

The reason for two apps is because the two libraries are very different.

Please note that any OIDC (OpenId Connect) compliant library is good.
